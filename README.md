# Where is Elon Musk?

This python based webscraper allows you to follow Elon Musk's plane through time. To be fair, it can follow any plane, just change the icao. Elon Musk was the teacher's request and I wanted a good grade. It's based on data from ADSB Exchange, the website not the database (but the website pulls from the database anyway).
